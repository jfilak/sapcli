# SAP CLI [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jfilak/sapcli.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jfilak/sapcli)

Command line interface to SAP products

This tool provides command line interface for ADT which should help you to
build your CI tools.

## Installation and usage

First of all you need Python3 (>=3.6) and then you need python-request module.
Nothing else because ADT works on level HTTP.

### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install git python3 python3-requests python3-openssl

git clone https://github.com/jfilak/sapcli.git
cd sapcli
./sapcli --help
```

## Features

The primary goal was to enable ABAP Unit testing

```bash
sapcli aunit run class zcl_foo --output junit4
sapcli aunit run program zfoo_report --output junit4
sapcli aunit run package '$local_package' --output junit4
```

, ATC checks triggering and installation of [abapGit](https://github.com/larshp/abapGit)
which is delivered as a single source ABAP program (report, SE38 thing).

```bash
sapcli package create '$abapgit' 'git for ABAP by Lars'
sapcli program create 'zabapgit' 'github.com/larshp/abapGit' '$abapgit'
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/abapGit/build/master/zabapgit.abap | sapcli program write 'zabapgit' -
sapcli program activate 'zabapgit'
```

See the complete list of supported operations in [doc/commands.md](doc/commands.md)

## Usage

You must provide the tool with hostname, client, user and password. It is
possible to use either command line parameters or environment variables.

You can prepare a configuration file like the following:

```bash
cat > .npl001.sapcli.openrc << _EOF
export SAP_USER=DEVELOPER
export SAP_PASSWORD=Down1oad
export SAP_ASHOST=vhcalpnlci
export SAP_CLIENT=001
export SAP_PORT=8000
export SAP_SSL=no
_EOF
```

and the you can source the configuration file in your shell to avoid the need
to repeat the configuration on command line parameters:

```bash
source .npl001.sapcli.openrc

sapcli package create '$abapgit' 'git for ABAP by Lars'
sapcli program create zabapgit 'github.com/larshp/abapGit' '$abapgit'
sapcli aunit run class zabapgit
```

The tool asks only for user and password if missing. All other parameters
either have own default value or causes fatal error if not provided.
